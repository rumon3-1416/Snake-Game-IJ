### Snake Game
[https://rumon3-1416.github.io/Snake-Game-IJ/](https://rumon3-1416.github.io/Snake-Game-IJ/)

This is a classic Snake game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating balls to grow longer. Each time the snake eats a ball, its length increases, making the game progressively more challenging. The game ends when the snake crashes into itself or the walls. After the game ends, the player's score is displayed.

## Features

- Arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
